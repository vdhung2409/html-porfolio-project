<h1>About Me</h1>
<h4>Hi there, I am so happy that you are here reading this to know a bit more about myself :D</h4>

<p>My name is David Vu. I am 26 year-old, I was born and raised in Vietnam. I came to Canada for my nursing school in 2017, graduated and became a Registered Practical Nurse in 2021. I have been working as a nurse in multiple healthcare setting such as long term care facilities, retirement homes, home care, acute care and non acute care in public hospitals.</p>

<p>In 2023, under pressure from healthcare crisis is currently happening in Ontario,Canada and feeling underappreciated from the government to healthcare workers, I have decided to pursue my career in a different path, to become a Web Developer.</p>

<p>I have been working in service industry since 2015 and as a nurse since 2021, I believe in my ability to provide high quality work with effective communication, attention to details, precision, accuracy, quick response and collaborative approach, and aspiration to function effectively as a team member in a team work environment.</p>
